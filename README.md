# BayCount
RCode and Data for the paper BayCount: A Bayesian Decomposition Method for Inferring Tumor Heterogeneity using RNA-Seq Counts

Instructions for Use of the Code:

All figures from the manuscript and the Supplementary Materials are to be reproduced. 

The R script simulation_main_K3.R in the folder /BayCount_Simulation_Code/BayCount_simulation_K3/ reproduces Figure 2, Figure 3 in the manuscript, and Figure S9, Figure S10 in the Supplementary Material;

The R script simulation_main_K5.R in the folder /BayCount_Simulation_Code/BayCount_simulation_K5/ reproduces Figure 4, Figure 5 in the manuscript, and Figure S11, Figure S12, Figure S17, Figure S18 in the Supplementary Material;

The R script simulation_main_true_K3.R in the folder /BayCount_Simulation_Code/BayCount_simulation_true_K3/ reproduces Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure S5, and Figure S6 in the Supplementary Material;

The R script simulation_main_true_K5.R in the folder /BayCount_Simulation_Code/BayCount_simulation_true_K5/ reproduces Figure S3, Figure S4, Figure S7, and Figure S8 in the Supplementary Material;

The R script BayCount_TCGA_KIRC_main.R in the folder /BayCount_TCGA_LUSC_KIRC/ reproduces Figure 8 in the manuscript, and Figure S15, Figure S16, Figure S19 in the Supplementary Material.

The R script BayCount_TCGA_LUSC_main.R in the folder /BayCount_TCGA_LUSC_KIRC/ reproduces Figure 6, Figure 7 in the manuscript, and Figure S13, Figure S14, Figure S19 in the Supplementary Material.

The R script Figure_YX.R in the folder /BayCount_TCGA_LUSC_KIRC/ is to be executed after execution of the R scripts BayCount_TCGA_KIRC_main.R and BayCount_TCGA_LUSC_main.R in the same folder. It reproduces Figure 9 in the manuscript, and Figure S20 in the Supplementary Material.
